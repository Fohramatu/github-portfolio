## 📊 Documentation Philosophy

Every project in this portfolio includes:
- **Executive Summary** - What problem was solved
- **Technical Report** - How it was solved (the methodology)
- **Proof** - Screenshots and logs validating success
- **Diagnostics** - Errors encountered and resolutions applied
- **Professional Standards** - Code/configs following industry best practices

This portfolio reflects how I approach security work: **with rigor, documentation discipline, and verifiable outcomes.**
